                           <p><br>1.1 These are the terms on which we (Local Plumbers We Care) will carry out the work for you. Please ensure that you read them carefully before asking our engineer to begin the work.</p>

                           <p><br>2.2 We will try to get to you as soon as possible and where possible before the time slot we have allocated to you, if, when we book the job, we consider the circumstances you have described to us are an emergency. However, this might not be possible if an event occurs which is outside of our control (see below).</p>
                      
                           <p><br>2.3 We will make every effort to arrive and to complete the work on time. However, we will not be liable or responsible for any delay or failure to carry out the work, due to an event outside our control such as poor traffic conditions, poor weather conditions or the failure of public or private telecommunications networks. If such an event happens, we will let you know as soon as possible and you can cancel the job if you no longer want us to carry out the work. We may cancel the job if the event lasts for more than 4 weeks.</p>
                      
                           <p><br>2.4 To enable us to carry out the work you will need to:</p>

                           <p><br>(b) ensure that the premises are clear and safe for us to access and that you own the premises and do not need the consent of another person to enable us to carry out the work.</p>
                      
                           <p><br>(c) ensure that any materials you provide to enable us to carry out the work are suitable. If you fail to do so, we may not be able to carry out the work and you may need to contact us to arrange a further visit.</p>
                      
                           <p><br>2.5 When our engineer has completed the job, he will complete a Job Sheet. This will include the time he arrived at the premises, the work carried out, the time that the work was completed and the price to be paid by you. You will be asked to sign the Job Sheet to confirm that this information is correct. If you think that any of the information listed on the Job Sheet is inaccurate, please telephone us on 0161 549 1009 or write to us at Hadfield House, Gordon St, Stockport SK4 1RR or email office@localplumberswecare.co.uk. We shall assign a Job Number to the job which will be written on the Job Sheet. Please quote the Job Number in all subsequent correspondence with us relating to the job.</p>
                      
                           <strong><p><br>3. PRICE AND PAYMENT</p></strong>

                           <p><br>3.1.1 For jobs booked on an hourly or half-hourly rate, labour will be charged from the moment that our engineer arrives at your premises at the hourly or half-hourly rate quoted and specified on the Job Sheet. For example, if our engineer is at your premises for 45 minutes, we will charge for one hour and we will charge you £125 for the work. Please note that all jobs are a minimum of an hour, we will charge for any time spent by our engineer diagnosing the work to be carried out.</p>
                      
                           <p><br>3.1.2 For jobs booked on a fixed price, you will be charged from the moment that our engineer arrives at your premises at the fixed price quoted and specified on the Job Sheet. For example, if we have told you that you will charge you a fixed price of £110 for the labour, we will charge you £110 for the labour, plus the cost of any parts that may be required. Some fixed price jobs also include the cost for parts, which we will confirm when you book the job.<br><br></p>

                           <p><br>6.3 If we have already begun to carry out the work and you decide to cancel any further work that needs to be carried out to complete the job then we may charge you for any labour, parts and materials used to carry out the work up to the point that you cancelled together with VAT.

However, where you have cancelled further work because of our failure to comply with these terms (except where we have been affected by an event outside our control),<br>you do not have to make any payment to us.<br><br></p>

                           <p><br>7.2 If we have to cancel an appointment under clause 6.1 and you have made any payment in advance for the work, we will keep £25 of the booking fee to cover administrative costs.

                           <strong><p><br>9. HOW WE MAY USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</p></strong>
                      
                           <p><br>9.1 We will use the personal information you provide to us to:</p>
                      
                           <p><br>(a) carry out the work.</p>
                      
                           <p><br>(b) process your payment for the work.</p>
                      
                           <p><br>(c) inform you about similar products or services that we provide,1, and we will always notify you in writing if this happens, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under these terms.</p>
                      
                           <p><br>10.2 This contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms.</p>
                      
                           <p><br>10.3 Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.</p>
                      
                           <p><br>10.4 If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.</p>
                      
                           <p><br>10.5 These Terms are governed by English law. We both agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts. However, if you are a resident of Northern Ireland, you may also bring proceedings in Northern Ireland, and if you are a resident of Scotland, you may also bring proceedings in Scotland.</p>
